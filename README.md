# java-total
Welcome to the Java world of programming. 

Java has consistently been in top 3 for now a decade on [Tiobe](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/).
It has earned a huge community base, and continuously growing upon it.

Among C, C++, Golang, Python and Java, Java is the youngest member of my bucket.
In this repo, I have added lot of `poc` code as the part of my learning.
I will keep on updating this repo, whenever I do an experiment with the language.
